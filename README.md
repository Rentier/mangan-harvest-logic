mangan-harvest-logic
=============

Cython + C++ module for simulating robots on the pacific seafloor. Lots faster than doing it python. This is, as the name indicates, only the logic. The main part and more documentation can be found on the [mangan-harvest-core](https://github.com/Rentier/mangan-harvest-core)
